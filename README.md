# Windows Calculator Clone

This repository hosts a Python-based project that serves as a demonstration of my Python skills. The project aims to recreate the classic functionality of the Windows Calculator. It's a learning and skill improvement exercise and not intended for commercial use. 

Utilizing the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface, this calculator offers a simple yet powerful tool for performing a variety of mathematical operations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
- **Advanced Mathematical Functions**: Access a range of mathematical functions, including square roots, exponents, and more, for complex calculations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Inspired by the traditional Windows Calculator, this project boasts an intuitive interface that is easy for anyone to use.
- **Keyboard Support**: For added convenience, users can input numbers and commands directly from their keyboard.
- **Cross-Platform**: Being Python-based and utilizing `tkinter`, this calculator is cross-platform and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
