# Python Calculator Project Update

Description:

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share an update on my Python calculator project. This project has been a journey of learning for me, as I delved into Python programming and GUI development using Tkinter.

I want to emphasize that this calculator is a work in progress, with approximately 75% of the intended functionality implemented. While basic operations like division are functional, some features are still in development.

One of the main challenges I encountered was structuring the code using classes, particularly in creating a Calculator class to organize the application's logic. Additionally, integrating Tkinter for the GUI proved to be a significant learning curve.

Despite the difficulties, I'm proud of the progress I've made and the knowledge I've gained along the way. This project has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of Python and GUI development techniques.

Thank you for following along on this journey, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions as I continue to refine and improve the calculator.
